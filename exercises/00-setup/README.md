# Setup

This tutorial is designed to get you up and running with Git and your local Python environment, and give you the basics of Jupyter notebooks.

It is composed of 3 parts:

- **[1. Git & GitHub](git.md)**
- **[2. Local Python environment](python_env.md)**
- **[3. Jupyter Notebooks & Jupyter Lab](jupyter.md)**

For the exercises, you also have the option to use a cloud-based Jupyter Lab environment, such as EPFL Noto. These cloud-based environments are convenient as they don't require an extensive local setup. You can find a tutorial on Noto **[here: `noto.md`](noto.md)**. However, for some parts of the course, such as the project, it will be useful to have a local environment set up, so you should still follow this tutorial even if you plan to use Noto for the exercises.

**To check that your environment can be used for the exercises, run the [`check_setup.ipynb` notebook](check_setup.ipynb).**
